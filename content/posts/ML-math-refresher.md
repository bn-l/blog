## Vectors

Quick intro

- A **quantity** with a direction and magnitude
- E.g. A bullet fired from a gun can be modelled as a 3 dimensional vector: The speed is the magnitude.
- A vector can be thought of an arrow (from an origin) or a point. A 3D vector is a point in 3D space.
- Each scalar in a vector is another dimension

- $\textbf{video}_3$ is the third element (math indexes at 1) of a vector named $\textbf{video}$. 
- In python can be represented as a List (or np.array)

## Norm

Length or magnitude of a vector

### L2 / Euclidian norm

- The shortest distance between the origin and the point (i.e. vector).
- is the $c^2$ in pythagoras' theorem: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$
    - Where $c^2$ is the vector.
- Also called the L2 norm for some reason

### L1 / Manhatten norm

- Is the sum of the absolute value of the scalars in a vector.
